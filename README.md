# Thetis_MIDI_controller
Control Thetis with your own Midi Controller

This project was inspired by another ham (ji1udd), who had made up a controller with a tuning knob and a few switches:
https://github.com/ji1udd/VFO-Controller
From his inspiration I first did a controller with one encoder, two potentiometers and 12 switches. What I also learned from his project was that the midi library he used was awesome. https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface
Through this library, all things midi became very easy to use.
I once had big dreams for my Nextion displays before I realized they weren't that easy to program. With the Control-Surface library it became super simple to make up a touch screen midi controller
The first one is a 2.5" tochscreen shown here with a 3D printed case I found on Thingaverse:
